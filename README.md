# MaintenanceMode-Issues

When creating an issue, please include the following information.
- MaintenanceMode version
- Whether you are using the plugin on a Spigot or a BungeeCord server
- Explanation of how to reproduce the issue
- The entire error message (!) if present

### MaintenanceMode API

There's no official repo, yet, but you can manually add the Maintenance-API.jar file to your library (can be downloaded in the code section, https://github.com/KennyTV/Maintenance/raw/master/Maintenance-API.jar).
By using MaintenanceBungeeAPI#getAPI or MaintenanceSpigotAPI#getAPI (depending on what server you are using the plugin) you can get some base methods. Documentation and/or a repo might come, if a few people ask me to.
