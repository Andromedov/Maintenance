# Contribution
As I'm just a random guy making this plugin as a fun side-project, it will never be "perfect".
Any improvement is welcome, as long as it fits with the general style of code, that should become apparent when looking at some of the other classes. :)

Generally, the used formatting is the default formatting of IntelliJ (Ctrl+Alt+L).
